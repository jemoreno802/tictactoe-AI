CSC242 Project 1

To run my project, open terminal, navigate to the correct directory and enter the commands:
	javac main.java
	java main

My program will begin with basic tic tac toe. You can enter if you would like to be X or O, keeping in mind that X plays first. My program will display the board and ask you to enter a position when it is your turn. After one game of the basic tic tac toe, my program will start playing 9-board tic tac toe. You can choose to be X or O, again with X playing first. A move in this game can be entered as two numbers 1-9 with a space in between them.
